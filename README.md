# Employee Salary Calculator

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

I will be creating an application that allows employees to track their monthly costs. By doing so, I will be recording monthly salaries and adding up the sum, to report end of month.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
